## Features

> TBD (features, code snippets, gifs, etc), using pitch/deliverables as placeholder

A landing page will feature a random color and its HEX code on launch which, when clicked, will generate a new random color.

An “explore” button below will scroll down, directing users to a number of random color cards generated using forEach to iterate through a random array of colors. Color cards, when generated, will display the color and its HEX, RGB and HSL codes. When hovered over, cards will enlarge. Clicking the “refresh” button below these cards will repopulate the color cards with a new array of random colors.

Via a collapsible sidebar menu, users will have the option to filter random colors by hues with reserved keywords [red, pink, purple, navy, blue, aqua, green, lime, yellow, orange].

Users will also be able to toggle between light & dark modes by clicking a button in the upper righthand corner of the application.
